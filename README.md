# üí´ About Me:
I am an experienced computer engineer specializing in hardware-software co-design, with a strong focus on developing and optimizing embedded systems and FPGA-based solutions. Currently pursuing a MASc in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, I am deeply involved in the design and verification of advanced multicore RISC-V SoCs, with expertise in firmware development, memory subsystem optimization, and hypervisor integration. My professional journey has seen me lead critical projects, including the development of an Electric Vehicle Fleet Management Device and the design of a safety-critical medical ventilator. My skill set spans across a wide range of technologies, including RISCV and ARM assembly, SystemVerilog, RTOS, and AI frameworks, reflecting a commitment to precision and innovation in every project I undertake.
